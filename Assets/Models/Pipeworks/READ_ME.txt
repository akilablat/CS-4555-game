Thank you for purchasing this asset pack!

Buy purchasing this pack you are permitted to use these assets in a commercial project, royalty free. However you are not permitted to distribute or sell these meshes on their own as raw assets. 

This pack contains 16 low poly static meshes that can be used for stylized games and films. The meshes are also UV mapped to allow you to apply tillable materials to them giving them limited use for photo-real styles. 
These meshes can be used in any 3D software that accept FBX format. 
This pack also includes a color pallet and several solid color color textures. The ‘valve’ mesh requires the color pallet for part of its texture, however the other meshes can use virtually any tileable texture for their materials.

The color pallet can easily be edited to create alternate pallets.
